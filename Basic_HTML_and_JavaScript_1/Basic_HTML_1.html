    <h1><em>A Beautiful View Of Mount Hood</em></h1>
    <p>
        <font color="aqua" face="impact" size="5"><b>Mount Hood is a dormant stratovolcano located in the Cascade Range
                of Oregon. It is the highest peak in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range. It is located
                about 50 miles east-southeast of Portland, on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties. In
                addition to being Oregon's highest mountain, it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on
                its prominence. Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt, though based on its
                history, an explosive eruption is unlikely. Still, the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are
                estimated at between 3 and 7 percent, so it is important to be prepared. </b></font>
