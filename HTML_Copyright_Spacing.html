    <h1>John&nbsp;15: 1-4</h1>
    <p>"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.<br><br>Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away;<br>and every branch that bears fruit He prunes,<br>that it may bear more fruit<br><br>You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you<br><br>Abide in me and I in you.<br>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine,<br>neither can you, unless you abide in me."
